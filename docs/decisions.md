# Decisions

When a dilemma comes up again, the answer and why are here, so it is decided
the same way without asking. Part A is how to decide; Part B is what was
decided, one entry each. `docs/conventions.md` is the rulebook; this file is
the reasoning behind the calls that shaped it.

## Part A: how to decide

- **The owner's rules come first.** A rule the code doesn't follow means the
  code is wrong: fix the code and add a check. Never drop or loosen a rule
  without asking the owner. (D1)
- **Make a rule true before you name an exception to it.** An exception is a
  hole the next person widens. (D6)
- **Fix a problem where it starts:** in the library, in the compositor, in the
  shared code, not around it in each caller. A mirin bug is fixed in mirin.
- **When two rules fight,** keep the one that protects what a person sees or
  what keeps them safe, and change what the other one measures, not its
  threshold. (D2)
- **A check starts from today's offenders and may only get stricter:** lists
  shrink, never grow. (D3)
- **Prefer no dependency when Dashi uses a sliver of one.** Take a dependency
  when it removes more code than it adds and its licences are permissive all
  the way down. (D4, D12)
- **When the cause can't be reproduced,** make the failure harmless and make
  the log tell us the cause next time. (D9)
- **A refactor changes no behaviour,** and is not done until the installed
  packages have been run, not only the checkout. (D10)
- **Narrowing who may do something is worth breaking a development
  convenience.** Never widen it to make a tool work. (D8)
- **What can be undone, decide and write down here.** What can't (publishing,
  deleting, anything outside the repository, dropping a rule, a change in what
  a person sees), ask the owner.

## Part B: the decisions

Numbered in the order they were written down; a new one goes at the end.

### D1. `lib/` and `shared/` came back, and the code was made to follow them

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (95278df8 removed them; da6a95a1 brought them back).
- **Question:** the rulebook's `lib/` rules were followed by nothing: no
  `lib/` folder existed. Drop the rules, or make the code follow them?
- **Choice:** first they were dropped, as "nothing uses it". That was a
  mistake: the rules were the owner's, taken from mirin's rulebook, and an
  unfollowed rule meant the code was wrong, not the rule. They came back the
  same day as hard rules H18 to H20, with `scripts/check-modules.ts`, and every
  module was moved into the shape (`index.ts`, `types.ts`, public files,
  `lib/`).
- **Why:** a module with one public surface and private insides is what the
  owner asked for in both repositories; a check keeps it true.
- **Cost:** every module of the repository moved into the shape, in six areas
  at once, and most import paths changed.
- **Undo:** none wanted. To drop a rule, ask the owner first.

### D2. H16 counts library modules at start, not Dashi's own

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (07c99949).
- **Question:** H16's ceiling counted every module the shell loads at start.
  H2's file splits added modules without adding code, and the count reached
  1006 against a ceiling of 1000. Raise the ceiling, or stop splitting?
- **Choice:** H16 counts library modules only (21 at the time, ceiling 25).
- **Why:** H16 protects start-up time from heavy libraries (the AI SDKs);
  H2 protects people reading the code. Neither should lose. Raising the
  ceiling would only have moved the fight; measuring the right thing ended it.
- **Cost:** a start-up made slower by Dashi's own files is no longer caught by
  H16. `scripts/entry-weight.ts` watches each entry point's modules instead.
- **Undo:** count every module again in `scripts/boot-weight.ts`, with a new
  ceiling.

### D3. Every hard rule's check starts from a list that may only shrink

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (279a74c3).
- **Question:** the hard rules had hundreds of offenders on the day they came
  in. Fix them all first, or let the checks pass on day one?
- **Choice:** each check starts from `scripts/lists/<name>.txt`, today's
  offenders and their counts. A new offender fails, a listed one may not grow,
  and one that got better must be trimmed (`--shrink`). Never add an entry by
  hand.
- **Why:** the rules could be enforced at once, on every push, while the old
  offenders were worked down.
- **Cost:** for a while a rule is true only for new code; a list is a debt to
  pay.
- **Undo:** none. A list reaching zero is the goal.

### D4. The AI SDKs were replaced by a small client of Dashi's own

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (`dashi-0.7.0-review/05-ai`).
- **Question:** keep `@anthropic-ai/sdk` and `openai` (loaded only when
  asked), move to the Vercel AI SDK, or write our own client?
- **Choice:** our own, `agents/ask/http.ts`: one JSON POST, a timeout for each
  try, one retry.
- **Why:** the answerers use one non-streaming request each, a timeout and a
  retry. The SDKs were 64 MB and 494 modules, Apache-2.0 code inside the MIT
  package; the Vercel AI SDK was 31 MB, permissive all the way down, but kept
  all our provider code and added a message-format conversion, so it removed
  nothing. Ours is 0 MB and one file.
- **Cost:** 193 more lines of Dashi's own (retry rules, `Retry-After`, the
  timeout), and keeping up with the providers' APIs by hand.
- **Undo:** put an SDK back behind `http.ts`'s callers. Take one only if it
  removes more code than it adds.

### D5. Outside code imports a module's `index.ts`, or names one public file

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (the `lib` areas, `dashi-0.7.0-review/11-lib`).
- **Question:** Bun loads every file a barrel re-exports. Must every importer
  use the index, even when that makes another process load the module's
  start-up?
- **Choice:** import the `index.ts`; name one public file (a file the index
  re-exports) only when the index would close an import cycle or load more in
  another process. `scripts/entry-weight.ts --check` holds every entry point
  to the modules it loads.
- **Why:** the index is the surface; but a barrel must never make an app or
  the settings preview load the shell's start-up.
- **Cost:** two ways to import a module, and a judgement for which.
- **Undo:** forbid naming public files in H19, and accept heavier processes.

### D6. Files' chooser moved to `src/shared/file-browser` rather than H4 naming an exception

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (08e377a4, this file's first change).
- **Question:** dashi-dialog, the portal and Text Editor imported the chooser
  from `apps/files`, which H4 forbids. Move it to the app kit, to
  `src/shared/`, or name the exception in H4?
- **Choice:** `src/shared/file-browser/`: the browser Files and the chooser
  share (store, operations, listing, sidebar, toolbar, the chooser). Files'
  window, menus and path bar stay in `apps/files`. The five other wrong-way
  imports were settled the same way: code two sides need moved to
  `src/shared/<concern>` (`app-entries`, `session-power`, `logind`, `cards`,
  the settings writer, the appearance reader), and `import-ways.txt` is empty.
- **Why:** code four programs use is shared code, not one app's private code.
  An exception would have been a hole in H4 that the next app widens. The kit
  was wrong: it is the runtime, not components, and every app would load the
  browser.
- **Cost:** the biggest move of the release (59 files); Files names public
  files rather than the index, so it doesn't load the chooser.
- **Undo:** `scripts/move.ts` the files back; but then H4 needs an exception,
  which is the owner's call.

### D7. Tests may import a nested module's public files

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (64a4210f).
- **Question:** a test of `agents/desktop`'s `Hands` reached a public file of a
  nested module, which H19 forbade when the outer index didn't re-export it.
  Widen the outer index for tests, put public pieces in `lib/`, or let tests
  in?
- **Choice:** a test may import a nested module's public files, as it may a
  top-level module's (`scripts/check-modules.ts`, `deep-imports`).
- **Why:** both other fixes made the code worse to suit the check. A nested
  module's public files are public; a test of them is a fair user.
- **Cost:** none in production code; tests see a little more.
- **Undo:** drop the nested-module line in `deepImports`.

### D8. "The shell" is the session client's process group and what it started

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (2c1d64b7, 657e7433, a007ad6a).
- **Question:** the compositor trusted any client under the session client,
  which is every app the launcher starts. Who is the shell, on the IPC and on
  the privileged Wayland protocols?
- **Choice:** the session client, its process group, and the sessions it
  started (each service it runs is `setsid`). An app the shell launches has a
  session of its own and is not the shell. One table (`ipc/table.rs`) says
  who may ask each method; the privileged protocols use the same rule
  (`session/trust.rs`).
- **Why:** screen capture, clipboard without focus, and the lock screen must
  not be any app's to take.
- **Cost:** `vm/vm ipc` from an ssh login lost the shell-only methods; it gets
  only what anyone may ask (`session`, `outputs`, `gpus`). An app that needs a
  privilege is granted it by the shell (`ipc-clients`, `screencopy-clients`).
- **Undo:** not wanted. Never widen the rule to make a tool work; grant the
  tool instead, or use `--open-ipc` on a compositor run by hand.

### D9. A frame the display refuses is drawn without planes

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (8d89f9b1, `dashi-0.7.0-review/12-flip`).
- **Question:** on the G14, every page flip failed with EINVAL while
  1Password's prompt was up, and the screen froze. Which plane the driver
  refused could not be proven: the VM has no overlay planes, and the kernel
  logs nothing without `drm.debug`.
- **Choice:** a refused commit steps down: the cursor plane only, then no
  planes; every plane is tried again after 5 s, doubling to 60 s. The log says
  what was on planes when refused and what worked, so the next time names the
  cause.
- **Why:** the screen must keep moving whatever the cause; the likeliest
  (amdgpu refusing a cursor over a scaled overlay) is a guess.
- **Cost:** some frames are composed instead of using planes, for a while: a
  little more GPU work.
- **Undo:** remove the step-down in `backend/udev/planes.rs`; first read the
  logs the laptop gave.

### D10. Shutdown runs in reverse start-up order, from one registry

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (495f1fd2).
- **Question:** the shell stopped its services from a hand-kept list of 79
  names, which drifted from the start-up order.
- **Choice:** each piece says how it stops on the line where it starts
  (`services.add(name, stop)`); `closeAll()` runs the stops in reverse, once,
  and one that throws doesn't stop the rest.
- **Why:** one list, which can't drift, and the order the pieces depend on.
- **Cost:** the shutdown order changed. The smoke test ran it from the checkout
  and from the installed packages (`dashi-0.7.0-review/10-smoke-final`), and
  the packages caught what the checkout couldn't: the `dashi` RPM lacked the
  new `@dashi/shape`, and the installed session did not start (7adb65d4). Hence
  Part A's rule: a refactor is not done until the packages have run.
- **Undo:** none wanted.

### D11. The compositor's IPC and the shell parse strictly; replies on screen are read leniently

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (f8e22188, a96e750c, `dashi-0.7.0-review/08-shape`).
- **Question:** the IPC was parsed by hand, with defaults for what was missing
  or wrong. Accept what can be read, or refuse what doesn't fit?
- **Choice:** both sides parse strictly: serde types that refuse unknown
  fields and out-of-range numbers in Rust, `@dashi/shape` in the shell, and a
  refusal names the field. A list shown on screen is read leniently
  (`lenientList`): one bad entry is dropped, not the whole list.
- **Why:** a bad frame is a bug to see, not to guess around; but losing one
  row of a list on screen is better than losing the screen.
- **Cost:** what used to be accepted is refused. A hand-edited settings file
  with a keyboard repeat over 100 loses the whole `keyboard` request, logged
  only.
- **Undo:** make a field lenient where losing it is harmless, one at a time,
  in the shape.

### D12. One parser for outside data, `@dashi/shape`, with no new dependency

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (a96e750c).
- **Question:** take a schema library (zod) or grow our own from the applet
  package's parser?
- **Choice:** `@dashi/shape`, grown from `applet/parse.ts`: one definition gives
  the parser, the type and a JSON Schema.
- **Why:** Dashi used a sliver of what a schema library does, and a JSON
  Schema it needs for agents' tools; a small kit of our own does both.
- **Cost:** the kit is ours to keep.
- **Undo:** replace the shapes with a library behind the same names.

### D13. Every check runs on every push, in CI, with mirin beside Dashi

- **Date:** 2026-11-10 (95278df8, `.github/workflows/check.yml`).
- **Question:** CI on GitHub Actions, or local hooks only?
- **Choice:** both: CI runs `bun run check` in a Fedora 44 container with
  mirin checked out beside the repository (the branch named like Dashi's, else
  `.mirin-branch`); `.githooks/pre-push` runs the quick ones.
- **Why:** a rule no machine runs isn't a rule; and Dashi doesn't build
  without its mirin.
- **Cost:** a mirin branch to keep for each Dashi branch that needs one.
- **Undo:** none wanted.

## How to add a decision

Add one entry at the end of Part B, in the commit that makes the change: its
number, the date, the question, the choice, why, what it cost, and how to undo
it. If it teaches a new way to decide, add a line to Part A naming it. Plain,
short words, as the rulebook is written.
